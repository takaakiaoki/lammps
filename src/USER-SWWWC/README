The files in this package are a potpourri of (mostly) unrelated
features contributed to LAMMPS by users.  Each feature is a single
pair of files (*.cpp and *.h).

More information about each feature can be found by reading its doc
page in the LAMMPS doc directory.  The doc page which lists all LAMMPS
input script commands is as follows:

doc/Section_commands.html, subsection 3.5

User-contributed features are listed at the bottom of the fix,
compute, pair, etc sections.

The list of features and author of each is given below.

You should contact the author directly if you have specific questions
about the feature or its coding.
